# Emacs-Init
This is a repository that will contain my Emacs `init.el` file so that if I ever want to work at a different Emacs workstation, I can easily load my customizations onto it. 
If you're interested in some of the customizations I have, go ahead and add my file to your load path!

### C-l as a method to clear the Eshell buffer
I used the second answer from [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7733668/command-to-clear-shell-while-using-emacs-shell) Stack Overflow question to bind `C-l` to a clear-screen method in Eshell. This is a must-have if you use Eshell extensively.
